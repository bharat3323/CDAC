/*
Consider that payroll software needs to be developed for computerization of
operations of an ABC organization. The organization has employees.
3.1. Construct a class Employee with following members using private access
specifies:
 Employee Id integer
 Employee Name string
 Basic Salary double
 HRA double
 Medical double=1000
 PF double
PT double
 Net Salary double
 Gross Salary double
Please use following expressions for calculations://Note:Don't accept HRA,PF PT from user
 * HRA = 50% of Basic Salary
* PF = 12% of Basic Salary
* PT = Rs. 200

3.2. Write methods to display the details of an employee and calculate the gross
and net salary.
* Goss Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + Medical
* Net Salary = Gross Salary â€“ (PT + PF)

Create Object of employee class and assign values and display Details.*/
