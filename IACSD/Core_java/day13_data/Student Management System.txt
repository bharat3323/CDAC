Design and implement a Student Admission Management System in Java.
(Try this definitely !)

Core Classes  - 

1. Student 
-id (auto-incremented)
- name(string)
- email (unique)
- marks (int)
- course (enum)
- admissionDate(LocalDate)

2. Course (enum)
CORE_JAVA, DBT, PYTHON , MERN, WEB_JAVA,DEV_OPS

Min marks required for admission

Max capacity (total seats available)


Functionalities

1. Admit Student
Input: name, email, marks, course
Validate:
Marks must be ≥ minMarks of the course
Course must have available seats
If valid -> admit student (add to list + reduce available seats).
Otherwise -> reject admission.

2. Cancel Admission
Input: email
If student found -> remove from list + free up one seat in the course.
If not found -> show error.

3. Search Student by Email
Input: email
If student exists -> display details
Else -> show “not found”

4. List All Students

5. List students by Course
Input - course name

6. Will add sorting options later....

Exit

Technical Requirements

Use an ArrayList<Student> to store all student records.

Ensure email is unique (equals)

Later, the system will be refactored to use HashMap.
