When does Java Iterator or ListIterator , throw java.util.ConcurrentModificationException ?

During iteration, if you are trying to structurally modify the List (i.e using List API - add or remove methods) , JVM aborts the iteration throwing the exception

Why - In above case , the positions of the iterator becomes in consistent.
So rather than risking inconsistent results , it aborts the iteration.

This is known as fail-fast behavior of the iterators in Java.

Soln - Attach Iterator n use it's own API.
