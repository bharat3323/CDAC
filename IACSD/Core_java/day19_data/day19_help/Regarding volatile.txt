What is the volatile keyword?

The volatile keyword in Java is used to mark a variable as "stored in main memory." 

This means that every time a thread accesses a volatile variable, it reads it from the main memory, and every time it writes to the variable, it writes to the main memory. 

This prevents threads from caching the value of the variable, ensuring visibility across all threads.
