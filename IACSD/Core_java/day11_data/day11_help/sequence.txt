Any problems noticed in non generic / raw / pre generic syntax

1. Any time , to access the data from non generic type , explicit down casting is required.
2. In case of , invalid down casting  or invalid assigments ,  javac DOES NOT detect the errors, JVM detects error . (ClassCastException)

The  solution to achieve the flexibility (i.e ANY type) as well as maintaining type safety @ compile time ? 
 Use - Generic syntax.

(It's meant for informing the javac --about actual data types, so that type mismatch errors are detected at the compile time)
